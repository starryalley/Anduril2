# ToyKeeper's Anduril flashlight firmware fork

This is a clone from [ToyKeeper's Flashlight Firmware](https://code.launchpad.net/flashlight-firmware) from branch [anduril2](https://code.launchpad.net/~toykeeper/flashlight-firmware/anduril2), revision [583](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~toykeeper/flashlight-firmware/anduril2/revision/583)

For toyKeeper's binary see [here](http://toykeeper.net/torches/fsm/)


# What's here

Since I plan to only work with my Emisar D4v2, I've deleted unrelated FW for other flashlights and many more stuffs from the huge repository.

Basically I copied the ToyKeeper/ stuff from the original repo and removed unrelated hwdef and configs there.

## Modification

Nothing yet.

# Usage

I've only included a build script for KR4-nofet (`spaghetti-monster/anduril/build-kr4-nofet.sh`) because that's the only light I own. (a Emisar D4v2 with E21A emitters).
